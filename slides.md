# What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected.

<v-clicks>

* **White Box Testing**: Unit tests are written with knowledge of how the code being tested works. 

* **Isolation**: Unit tests focus on a small, isolated piece of code (a 'unit'), such as a single class or function. 

* **Automated**: Unit tests are typically written to be run automatically. 

* **Part of Development**: Unit tests are usually written by the same developers who write the code.

# Why is it Important?

<v-clicks>

 * **Catching bugs early**: Unit testing finds problems early in the development cycle, making them cheaper and easier to fix.

 * **Simplifying integration**: It helps ensure that individual parts are working correctly before they're combined with others.

 * **Facilitating change**: Well-tested components can be modified with confidence. They provide a safety net against potential bugs from new changes.
 
 * **Improving design**: Writing tests often leads to better code design, as it forces developers to consider how their code will be used and how it interacts with other parts.

# Testing Pyramid

<v-clicks>

* **Unit Testing**: Tests individual functions or methods in isolation.

* **Integration Testing**: Tests the interaction between different components of the system.

* **End-to-End Testing**: Simulates real-world user interactions and tests the entire application from start to finish.

# Basic Unit Test Structure

```kotlin {all|3-6|8-11|13-16|all}
internal class SomeClassTest {
  
  @BeforeEach
  fun `Set up SUT`(){
    // set up generic system under test...
  }

  @Test
  fun `Given ... When ... Then ...`() {
    // test implementation
  }

  @AfterEach
  fun `Tear down SUT`(){
    // clean up ...
  }
}
```
